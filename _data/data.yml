experiences:
    - role: Consultant - Software Developer
      time: 2020 - Present
      company: CGI, Chippenham 
      details: |
        Following our excellent record, SCISYS was acquired by CGI in 2020.
        I continued to work with a reputable government department to build
        a product helping to manage changeable, quality-assured data throughout
        the UK on a .NET stack. This involved building a large API with a full
        body of automated tests.
        
        I also worked on various projects for different departments
        which made use of a Django/Python and JavaScript stack deployed into
        AWS and Azure with automated testing using pytest and selenium. I
        preferred this stack and I implemented most of the features for CGI's
        internal IP in this area.
    - role: Software Engineer
      time: 2018 - 2020
      company: SCISYS (Enterprise Solutions and Defence), Chippenham
      details: |
        A goal of mine was to find a role of real responsibility upon leaving
        university. SCISYS allowed me to skip a Junior role and helped me massively
        improve my skills. I had a hand in creating a GeoSpatial platform for a
        government client - allowing them to upload, edit, create, observe, and
        share data to aid policy-making in government and industry. We used Python,
        Django, Docker, and Kubernetes, along with our CARTOSYS stack of tools
        to deploy a solution to Microsoft Azure. Initially, I was part of a team
        iterating upon the CARTOSYS Toolkit.
